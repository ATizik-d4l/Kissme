# KotlinMultiplatformStorage
KotlinMultiplatformStorage is an open-source Kotlin Multiplatform key-value storage library. It allows you to store key-value data in common module without any additional boilerplate code.

Currently library supports following platforms:
- android
- ios_arm64
- ios_x64

## Download
To use this library in your project, add Netguru bintray url to the repositories block:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {  url 'https://dl.bintray.com/netguru/maven/' }
}
```

Then add following dependencies to the common module build.gradle:
```groovy
    sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation 'com.netguru.kotlinmultiplatformstorage:kotlinmultiplatformstorage-common:0.1.0'
            }
        }
        androidMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation 'com.netguru.kotlinmultiplatformstorage:kotlinmultiplatformstorage-android:0.1.0'
            }
        }

        iosMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation 'com.netguru.kotlinmultiplatformstorage:kotlinmultiplatformstorage-ios:0.1.0'
            }
        }
    }
```

Remember to enable `GRADLE_METADATA` in `settings.gradle`:
```groovy
enableFeaturePreview('GRADLE_METADATA')
```
## Usage
Just instantiate `MultiPlatformStorage` in common module class and enjoy! It's as simple as that!
You don't have to initialize it by yourself. You don't have to pass `Context`. Everything is done automatically.
```kotlin
val storage = MultiPlatformStorage(name = "some_storage")
```
`name` parameter is optional, and you can omit it if you want to use default storage.
`MultiPlatformStorage` allows you to store and persist multiple data types:
- String
- Int
- Long
- Float
- Double
- Boolean 

If you want to store something, just call:
```kotlin
storage.putString(key = "someKey", value = "value")
```

If you want to get stored value - use:
```kotlin
storage.getString(key = "someKey", defaultValue = "default")
```

All `get()` functions will return `defaultValue` parameter if storage doesn't contain selected `key`.

You can get all keys stored in `MultiPlatformStorage` by calling:
```kotlin
storage.getAll()
```

You can check if `MultiPlatformStorage` contains selected `key` by calling:
```kotlin
storage.contains(key = "someKey")
```

You can also remove selected key from storage:
```kotlin
storage.remove(key = "someKey")
```

Last, but not least, you can remove all data stored in `MultiPlatformStorage`:
```kotlin
storage.clear()
```

## About
`KotlinMultiPlatformStorage` allows to store key-value pairs in platform-specific way.

### Android
Android implementation uses `SharedPreferences` interface. Library allows you to choose between storing
values in named or default preferences provided by `PreferenceManager`.

`SharedPreference` instance is initialized lazily when calling one of the available functions
using application `Context` which is provided automatically by `ContentProvider`.

### iOS

As we all know `UserDefaults` isn't best place to store app secrets, that's why iOS implementation is using native iOS Keychain. Security Enclave is a hardware-based key manager that's isolated from processor. It allows you to store, delete, fetch passwords and accounts. 

`Keychain` is simple wrapper build upon `Security` interface to store, save, and fetch not only passwords, but also accounts.

## Running sample app
Sample app uses Maven Local for resolving `KotlinMultiPlatformStorage` dependencies. Before running sample app you need to:
1. Build the library - `./gradlew build`
2. Publish dependencies to Maven Local - `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`
3. Run selected library. If you want to run iOS app - you need to properly configure Xcode.
 Please check: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/native/mpp-ios-android.html#setting-up-xcode before running iOS sample app.
